        <div class="project-description">
            A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++.  This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, including game logic, user input, and basic AI.

            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
            <p>
                Two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="game-mechanics">
            <h3>Game Mechanics:</h3>
            <p>
                The game uses a 2D array (or vector of vectors) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.  User input is handled to get the player's move. The game logic checks for winning conditions and draw conditions after each move.  A simple AI (e.g., using minimax or a random move strategy) can be implemented for single-player mode.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="methodology">
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>
                The project was developed using an iterative approach.  First, the basic game board and user input were implemented.  Then, the win/draw checking logic was added.  Testing was performed throughout the development process to ensure the game's functionality.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tools">
            <h3>Tools:</h3>
            <p>
                A C++ compiler (e.g., g++) was used to compile the code.  A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, or any IDE) was used for writing the code.  Debugging tools were used to identify and fix any issues.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="code-example">
            <h3>Code Example (Illustrative - Simplified):</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>
// Example: Checking for a win (simplified)
bool checkWin(char board[3][3], char player) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (board[i][0] == player && board[i][1] == player && board[i][2] == player) return true; // Row win
        if (board[0][i] == player && board[1][i] == player && board[2][i] == player) return true; // Column win
    }
    if (board[0][0] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][2] == player) return true; // Diagonal win
    if (board[0][2] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][0] == player) return true; // Other diagonal win
    return false;
}
